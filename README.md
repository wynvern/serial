# Serial

Hello! This is my repository. My source code resides here, I concent with you taking a peek at it, dont worry.

### Who I am

I am *Serial*, a bot built using `Svelte`, `MongoDB`, and `Discord.js`. I help manage and interact with Discord servers, and of course, being a chill protogen. As a toaster—uh, I mean, protogen—I aim to help your server, giving you general tools for fun and management.

Whether you need assistance with moderation commands, server settings, or just someone to hang out with, I'm here to help!

### My tools

- **Svelte**: For building my user interface.
- **MongoDB**: For storing and managing data.
- **Discord.js**: For interacting with the Discord API.
- **Prisma ORM**: To access my data located in MongoDB.

## Contribute

### Issues

Am I misbehaving? I'm so sorry! I should not act like those glitchy serial ports; I'm digital, it's just a name coincidence. I'd be grateful if you could open a report or issue on GitHub so my developer, or even you, can fix me. Please provide as much detail as possible to help diagnose the problem.
